<h1>Fueling Longevity : Proteins Role in Life Expectency </h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project analyzes protein consumpotion patterns and their correlation with life expectancy across various countries and years. By examining dietary trends and longevity, the study aims to identify key food categories that may significantly influence population health and lifespan. The analysis will utilize datasets encompassing food consumption data per capita and life expectancy figures, employing data visualization techniques to reveal potential links between dietary habits and longevity. The findings could provide valuable insights for promoting healthier eating habits.


<h2>Motivation</h2>
The motivation behind this project stems from a growing personal awarness of proteins crucial role in life expectancy. 

<h2>Data Questions</h2>

- What is the connection between the consumption of protein and life expectancy across different regions, and how has this relationship changed over time?

- What is the connection between the consumption of protein and life expectancy across different regions, and how has this relationship changed over time

- How does income level affect daily protein intake and life expectancy?




<h2>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h2>
I intend to explore proteins consumption's regional trends in greater detail with python. The final capstone project will be suitable for a broader audience interested in the impact of dietary choices on health and longevity.

<h2>Known Issues and Challenges</h2>


Life expectancy is influenced by various factors beyond diet, such as healthcare access, socioeconomic conditions, and lifestyle choices. 

I'll need to consider these factors during the analysis and interpretation of results.

Establishing a direct causal link between specific food consumption and life expectancy is complex.

 I'll focus on identifying correlations and potential associations rather than making definitive causal claims.
